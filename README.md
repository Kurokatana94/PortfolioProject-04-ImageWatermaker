# Image Watermarker in Tkinter

### How does it work?
- Simply open the .exe file and insert the image to watermark in this entry (you can use also an image url):

![img_1.png](docs/img_1.png)

- Then you can choose an image or type some text in the appropriate entries to create watermarks:

![img_2.png](docs/img_2.png)

- As you can see there's different options to further edit your watermarks.
